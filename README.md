# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Project Overview
In order to assist Pewlett-Hackard understand the number of people likely to retire over the next few years, we have been asked to perform a data analysis. In addition to this, we are tasked with identifying the number of employees that could be trained to fill the open roles left by the people likely to retire. The Pewlett-Hackard organization needs to know if they will need to hire externally and if so then how many along with who they will need to train that are already employed. We will also identify the number of employees eligible for a mentorship program based on their title.

## Results
- Pewlett-Hackard will be losing 90,398 people over the next few years determined by the employees born from 1952 to 1955 data.

## Summary
In summary, there will be 90,398 open positions over the next few years. With only 1,549 employees eligible for mentorships, Pewitt-Hackard will need to hire 88,849 people externally.

Currently, there are numerous employees close to retirement that are able to train new employees to fill their current roles but the hiring process would need to be fast tracked to make sure there is enough time for proper training to fill the future positions. Unfortunately, there are not enough employees eligible for mentorship since Pewitt Hackard limits this program to those born in 1965. I would reccommend changing this requirement in order to include younger employees. This would allow for people who already work for and thus familiar with the company to expand their horizons and to the company's benefit, fill the many open positions determined to be left open in the next few years.
