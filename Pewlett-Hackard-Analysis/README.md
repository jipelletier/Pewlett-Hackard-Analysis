# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Project Overview
In order to assist Pewlett-Hackard understand the number of people likely to retire over the next few years, we have been asked to perform a data analysis. In addition to this, we are tasked with identifying the number of employees that could be trained to fill the open roles left by the people likely to retire. The Pewlett-Hackard organization needs to know if they will need to hire externally and if so then how many along with who they will need to train that are already employed. We will also identify the number of employees eligible for a mentorship program based on their title.

## Results
- Pewlett-Hackard will be losing 90,398 people over the next few years determined by the employees born from 1952 to 1955 data.
